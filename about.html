                    <p>I am Abdullah Kadiwala, and I am a student looking forward to becoming a computer programmer and web designer in the future. I was born in Mumbai, India and then moved to Johannesburg, South Africa.</p> 
                    <p>I did my primary Schooling in South Africa where I was able to learn many skills. I developed my interest in the field of computers since a very young age. I used to try different styles and designs while completing my project given in school and should always try to do new things with the computers. Along with computers I was also interested in playing cricket and Soccer.</p>
                    <p>I spent 10 years in South Africa which has given me many great memories. I am a very big fan of Cricket and Soccer, and I was lucky to have watched many matches at the Stadiums in South Africa which include matches of the

                    </p> 
                    <p>In 2013, we left South Africa and moved to Vadodara, India. It felt quite different at the start but then everything got back on track. I completed my Secondary and Higher Secondary Education and with time my interests in the field of computer grew as I was able to learn different languages and skills. I learned BASIC, SQL and Python and I was able to make different projects with the help of these languages.</p> 
                    <p>And now I am looking forward to coming Canada and get closer to my goal of becoming a computer engineer.</p>
